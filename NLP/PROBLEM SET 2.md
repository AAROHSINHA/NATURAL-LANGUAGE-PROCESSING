## 1. What is Sentiment Analysis?

**Sentiment Analysis**, also called *opinion mining*, is a technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** used to determine the **emotional tone** of a piece of text. It classifies the sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** â€” and sometimes into more fine-grained emotions (like joy, anger, sadness).

It helps machines understand **subjective human language** and extract opinions, feelings, or attitudes from it.
